/*
Josh's epiphany that may need correcting:
- I was struggling with using the proper syntax of dot & bracket notation when dealing with objects and arrays. Literally every task I was fighting undefined errors and not knowing why & spending 15 minutes *each time I tried to write a property*. Painful. After a *very* long debate with Ren, I think this is the problem I was having & the solution/explanation:
-I couldn't understand why I had to use string literals inside some []'s but not others. My brain fails at remembering the simple idea of "use style a here, but style b there" when they're so similiar. Cue a 2 hr JS architecture discussion to untangle a possible explanation.
=>In JS:
  -object keys are actually strings that JS assumes the quotes around.
    --name in the latte object below is actually "name", JS just doesn't make us type the quotes.
      (exception for when they're a space or special character that makes makes the key look like not a string. The exception is 100% not the issue I was struggling with though.)
    --this means thatwhen I try to reference a key in an object:
      ---dot notation will also assume the  quotes around that name. (again, exception forces literal quotes, which forces bracket notation. not the struggle-issue though)
      ---bracket notation however, *DOES NOT* assume the quotes around name.
        ----(Which is why I can use "name banana" in bracket notation for example)
        ----This means that I *must* use quotes for JS to understand I'm refering to the existing (implied) string key.
        ----If I don't use quotes in bracket notation, it will be looking for a variable instead of a, implied string. (like we did in task 3 for examples)

        Correct?
        yes, this is probably implicitly understood by many, but this was one of the hardest bits for me so far in LS.
